# Interview me about the plan

Read $ARGUMENTS and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious.

Ask ONE question at a time. Be probing and challenge assumptions. Cover areas like:
- Architecture and implementation approach
- Edge cases and failure modes
- Security and privacy implications
- Performance and scalability
- User experience flows
- Data models and persistence
- Testing strategy
- Dependencies and integrations

Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until I say "done" or all critical areas are covered.

Then update the spec file with:
- Decisions made during the interview
- Requirements and acceptance criteria
- Open questions and risks
- Implementation notes
