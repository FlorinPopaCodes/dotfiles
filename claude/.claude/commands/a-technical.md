# Interface prompt for non-technical users

This is my prompt: <prompt>$1</prompt>

Can you spin off an async background agent to do this and then periodically poll it as it does work and summarize what is happening.  

I'm not technical at all so please summarize it in a simple way for me. Use the explore agent to summarize how things work (that the other agent is working on) so I can learn while I do this. If the background agent runs into any errors, please stop and tell me but guide me in how I might be able to fix it.  

Remember I am non technical, so any technical language at all is not useful to me.
